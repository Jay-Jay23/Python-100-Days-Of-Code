## Exercise 1 - Defining and Calling Python Functions
Instructions:
<ul
<li>Reeborg's World is very similar to Karel the robot as it allows us to write Python code. And it's very easy to get started.</li>
<li>Using the commands available in Reeborg's Keyboard, define a function that allows him to turn right.</li>
<li>Afterwards code instructions for Reeborg to move in a square by calling the turn_right() function when necessary.</li>
</ul>

## Exercise 2 - The Hurdles Loop Challenge
Instructions:
<ul
<li>Reeborg's World Hurdles Challenge 1</li>
<li>Reeborg has entered a hurdles race. Make him run the course, following the path shown.</li>
</ul>
 
## Output:

## Exercise 3 - While Loops
Instructions:
<ul
<li>Reeborg's World Hurdles Challenge 2</li>
<li>Reeborg has entered a hurdle race, but he does not know in advance how long the race is. Make him run the course, following a path similar to the one shown, but stopping at the only flag that will be shown after the race has started.</li>
</ul>

## Exercise 4 -  Hurdles Challenge Using While Loops
Instructions:
<ul
<li>Reeborg's World Hurdles Challenge 3</li>
<li>Reeborg has entered a hurdle race. Make him run the course, following the path shown.</li>
<li>The position and number of hurdles changes each time this world is reloaded.</li>
</ul>
