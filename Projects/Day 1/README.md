## Exercise 1 - Printing
Instructions:
<ul
<li>Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

  </ul>
</details>



## Exercise 2 - Debugging Practice  
Instructions:
<ul
<li>Look at the code in the code editor on the right. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.</li>
</ul>
<code>#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
 </code>

## Exercise 3 - Input Function 
Instructions:
<ul
<li>You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:</li>
</ul>

## Exercise 4 - Variables  
Instructions:
<ul
<li>You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.</li>
<li>Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.</li>
<li>When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".</li>
<li>When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`</li>
<li>And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"</li>
</ul>
