## Challenge 2 - Replacing Blanks with Guesses
Instructions:
<ul>
<li> Create an empty List called display</li>
<li>For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.</li>
<li>So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.</li>
<li>Loop through each position in the chosen_word</li>
</ul>

## Challenge 3 - Check if the Player Won
Instructions:
<ul>
<li> Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.</li>
</ul>
