## Exercise 1 - Average Height 
Instructions:
<ul
<li>You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.</li>
<li>Important You should not use the <b>sum()</b> or<b>len()</b> functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.</li>
</ul>

## Exercise 2 - High Score 
Instructions:
<ul
<li>You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.</li>
