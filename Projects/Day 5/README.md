# Python Loops

## Exercise 1 - Average Height 
Instructions:
<ul
<li>You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.</li>
<li>Important You should not use the <b>sum()</b> or<b>len()</b> functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.</li>
</ul>

## Exercise 2 - High Score 
Instructions:
<ul
<li>You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.</li>
<li>e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]</li>
<li><b>Important</b> you are not allowed to use the <b>max</b> or <b>min</b> functions.</li>
</ul>

  </ul>

## Exercise 3 - Adding Even Numbers 
Instructions:
<ul
<li>You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:</li>
<li>i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100</li>
<li>Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.</li>
</ul>

## Exercise 4 - FizzBuzz 
Instructions:
<ul
<li>You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.</li>
<li>Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.</li>
<li>When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".</li>
<li>When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`</li>
<li>And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"</li>
</ul>
