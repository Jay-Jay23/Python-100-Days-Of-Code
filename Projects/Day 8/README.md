## Exercise 2 - Prime Number Checker
Instructions:
<ul>
    <li>Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1. Write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.</li>
    <li>E.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2. But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.</li>
</ul>
