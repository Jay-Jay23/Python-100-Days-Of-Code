# Python-100-Days-Of-Code
I have used the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">"100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp"</a> course as guiding materials and for project ideas while participating in the <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">#100DaysOfCode challenge</a>.

This repository will contains all 100 projects I have created during the challenge in the project directory. Some of the projects were create while coding along the lessons, but most are spin-off projects I have created by myself using the technology introduced in the video lesson.
